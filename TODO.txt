TODO list for molecule-polarity (HTML5)

HIGH
- #1 rewrite ElectronDensityNode and ElectrostaticPotentialNode using a single path that can be filled with a linear gradient that contains alpha

MEDIUM
- #1 black partial charge symbol is difficult to see against dark Electron Density surface
    - use transparency in surfaces, as in Java version
    - reimplement surface shapes
- #2 max length of molecular dipole makes it go off screen and past center of plates
    - show example
    - solve for plates, ignore for off-screen
- #3 custom cursor to indicate molecule rotation
    - show example
    - curved arrows, double-head, same color as atom, perpendicular to molecular dipole
    - triatomic molecule only?
    - input listener on bonds?

- E-field on/off: leave as 2 radio buttons, or change to OnOffSwitch?

LOW
- replace some node/shape creation code with transforms

REAL MOLECULES SCREEN
- how to read Jmol resource files? (.mol2)
