TODO list for molecule-polarity (HTML5)

=========================================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

HIGH
- composite partial charge is on wrong side of atomB in triatomic molecule
- composite partial charge doesn't rotate with molecule
- BondDipoleNode
- MolecularDipoleNode
- molecule doesn't line up correctly when e-field is turned on (disabled in model)

MEDIUM
- implement all features for 'Real Molecule' screen except JSmol
- diatomic molecule surface overlaps bond-character display
- Reset All moves molecule to origin (upper left), and other issues (partial charges,...)
- custom cursor to indicate molecule rotation
- add icons to 'bond dipole' and 'molecular dipole' check boxes

LOW
- adjust layout
- bond isn't visible on 'electron density' surface when both EN values are the same, use stroked Rectangle

REAL MOLECULES SCREEN
- how to read Jmol resource files (.mol2)
- where to put 'rainbow' option for electrostatic potential

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- PolarCartesianConverter (or use Vector2.angle,...)
